These are the supplemental materials for the paper: 
Kyle Thayer, Sarah E. Chasins, and Amy J. Ko. 2020. A Theory of Robust API Knowledge. ACM Trans. Comput.Educ.1, 1 (December 2020).

Included are two sets of files:
1) Files for the tasks we had participants do for the study (instructions, example code, their starting task code, and our solution code for the tasks). 
2) Files with the data we gathered from participants as well as our analysis (both qualitative coding and R scripts for statistical modeling).
