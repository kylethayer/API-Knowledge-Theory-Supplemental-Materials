# Study code tasks

These folders contain the JavaScript for the four API task sets plus the
practice task with SlickGrid.

For each API, there are working example files, a task files, and a task solution files
(except for SlickGrid). We made some small modifications to keep these examples working.

We do not include the annotated code here since some of the annotation content
is copied from Wikipedia which has restrictions on redistribution. Instead,
the annotated code is available here:

## D3:
Example: https://kylethayer.github.io/API-Knowledge-Theory-Supplemental-Materials/study%20tasks/d3/d3-example.html

Task starting point: https://kylethayer.github.io/API-Knowledge-Theory-Supplemental-Materials/study%20tasks/d3/d3-task.html

Task (our solution): https://kylethayer.github.io/API-Knowledge-Theory-Supplemental-Materials/study%20tasks/d3/d3-task-solution.html

## ThreeJS:
Example: https://kylethayer.github.io/API-Knowledge-Theory-Supplemental-Materials/study%20tasks/ThreeJS/ThreeJS-Example.html

Task starting point: https://kylethayer.github.io/API-Knowledge-Theory-Supplemental-Materials/study%20tasks/ThreeJS/ThreeJS-Task.html

Task (our solution): https://kylethayer.github.io/API-Knowledge-Theory-Supplemental-Materials/study%20tasks/ThreeJS/ThreeJS-Task-Solution.html

## Natural:
Example: https://kylethayer.github.io/API-Knowledge-Theory-Supplemental-Materials/study%20tasks/Natural/natural-example.js

Task starting point: https://kylethayer.github.io/API-Knowledge-Theory-Supplemental-Materials/study%20tasks/Natural/natural-task.html

Task (our solution): https://kylethayer.github.io/API-Knowledge-Theory-Supplemental-Materials/study%20tasks/Natural/natural-task-solution.html

Based on the documentation in the readme.md here:

Note: We did include more files for the Natural library, since we had significant
custom code, and it took effort to get Natural to run in a browser and the
license is permissive.

## OpenLayers:
Example: https://kylethayer.github.io/API-Knowledge-Theory-Supplemental-Materials/study%20tasks/OpenLayers/OpenLayers-Example.html

Task starting point: https://kylethayer.github.io/API-Knowledge-Theory-Supplemental-Materials/study%20tasks/OpenLayers/OpenLayers-Task.html

Task (our solution): https://kylethayer.github.io/API-Knowledge-Theory-Supplemental-Materials/study%20tasks/OpenLayers/OpenLayers-Task-Solution.html

Based on various examples from:

## SlickGrid (practice task):

Note: No links to working version. To get these to work, you'll need to download the dataset yourself.

Based on examples from:
