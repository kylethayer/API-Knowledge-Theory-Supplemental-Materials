# Study code tasks

These folders contain the JavaScript for the four API task sets plus the
practice task with SlickGrid.

For each API, there is an example file, a task file, and a task solution file
(except for SlickGrid). Since our main interest is the code, we focused on
preserving the JavaScript portions participants observed. The rest should be
reconstructable from the examples (listed below).

We do not include the annotated code here since some of the annotation content
is copied from Wikipedia which has restrictions on redistribution. Instead,
the annotated code is available here:

## D3:
Based on these example:

## ThreeJS:
Based on this examples:

## Natural:
Based on the documentation in the readme.md here:

  https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural

Note: We did include more files for the Natural library, since we had significant
custom code, and it took effort to get Natural to run in a browser and the
license is permissive.

## OpenLayers:
Based on various examples from:
